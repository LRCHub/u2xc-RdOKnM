If only I could understand,
How I feel inside (now)
If only I could understand,
What it really means to love before I move on
If only you could,
If only you could,
If only you could understand how I feel
And maybe all I can,
And maybe all I can do, is accept (I'm caught in a)
De ja vu
De ja vu
I'm lookin' out for somethin' new,
But I keep comin' back to you
(I'm caught in a)
De ja vu
De ja vu
De ja vu
De ja vu
De ja vu
I'm lookin' out for somethin' new,
But I can't get enough of you (De ja vu)
(I'm caught in a de ja vu)
Maybe all I can do,
Is accept what I've grown in to
Maybe all I can do,
Is accept it, accept it (de ja vu)
If only you could,
If only you could,
If only you could understand how I feel
And maybe all I can,
And maybe all I can do, is accept (I'm caught in a de ja vu)
I'm lookin' out for somethin' new,
But I keep comin' back to you
I'm lookin' out for somethin' new,
But I can't get enough of you, de ja vu
(I'm caught in a de ja vu)
I'm lookin' out for somethin' new,
But I keep comin' back to you
I'm lookin' out for somethin' new,
But I can't get enough of you, de ja vu
I'm lookin' out for somethin' new,
But I can't get enough of you, de ja vu
